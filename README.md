# inlabruSDMs

inlabruSDMs is an R package used to construct species distribution models from a variety of different data sources. It does so by building wrapper functions around [GitHub](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13168), which uses the [INLA methodology](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00700.x) to estimate a class of latent Gaussian models.
