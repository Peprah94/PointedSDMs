\title{\emph{blockedCV}: run spatial blocked cross-validation on the integrated model.}
\usage{
blockedCV(data, options = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object produced by \code{\link{intModel}}. Requires the slot function, \code{.$spatialBlock} to be run first in order to specify how the data in the model is blocked.}

\item{options}{A list of \pkg{INLA} or \pkg{inlabru} options to be used in the model. Defaults to \code{list()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{blockedCV}, which is essentially a list of DIC values obtained from each iteration of the model.
}
\description{
This function is used to perform spatial blocked cross-validation with regards to model selection for the integrated model. It does so by leaving out a block of data in the full model, running a model with the remaining data, and then calculating the deviance information criteria (DIC) as a score of model fit.
}
\examples{

\dontrun{

#Create dataSDM object

dataObject <- intModel(...)

#Create the spatial block

dataObject$spatialBlock(...)

#Perform spatial blocked cross-validation

cv_scores <- blockedCV(dataObject, 
                       options = list(control.inla = list(int.strategy = 'eb')))

#Print summary of the scores

cv_scores

}
