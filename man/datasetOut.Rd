\title{FdatasetOut: Function that removes a dataset out of the main model, and calculates some cross-validation score.}
\usage{
datasetOut(model, dataset, predictions = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model of class bru_sdm run with all datasets.}

\item{dataset}{Datasets to leave out. If missing, will run for all datasets used in the full model.}

\item{predictions}{Will new models be used for predictions. If \code{TRUE} returns marginals and bru_info in model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list of inlabru models with the specified dataset left out. If predictions is \code{FALSE}, these objects will be missing their \code{bru_info} and \code{call} lists.
}
\description{
This function calculates the difference in covariate values between a full integrated model and a model with one dataset left out, as well as some cross-validation score based on the effect of leaving out the dataset.
}
\examples{

\dontrun{

#Set up a dataSDM object

object <- intModel(...)

#Run a joint model

joint_model <- runModel(object)

#Leave dataset out, cross-validation

dataset_out <- datasetOut(model = joint_model,
                          dataset = unique(joint_model$source),
                          predictions = TRUE)
                          
#Print summary of reduced models
