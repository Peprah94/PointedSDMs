\title{FdatasetOut: Function that removes a dataset out of the main model, and calculates some cross-validation score.}
\usage{
datasetOut(model, dataset, predictions = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model of class bru_sdm run with all datasets.}

\item{dataset}{Datasets to leave out.}

\item{predictions}{Will new models be used for predictions. If \code{TRUE} returns marginals and bru_info in model. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list of inlabru models with the specified dataset left out. If predictions is \code{FALSE}, these objects will be missing their \code{bru_info} and \code{call} lists.
}
\description{
This function calculates the difference in covariate values between a full bru_sdm model and a model with one dataset left out, as well as some cross-validation score based on the effect of leaving out the dataset.
