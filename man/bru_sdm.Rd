  covariatesbydataset = NULL,
  specieseffects = FALSE,
  pointsintercept = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A bru_sdm_data object created with \code{organize_data}.}

\item{spatialcovariates}{Data frame of the spatial covariates accompanied by their associated coordinates. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{covariatestoinclude}{A vector of spatial covariate names to include in the model. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{covariatesbydataset}{A named list which includes which covariates are modeled to each dataset. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{specieseffects}{Calculate effects for the species. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{pointsintercept}{Include individual intercepts for each point process in the model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{marksintercept}{Include individual intercepts for each mark process in the model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{sharedspatial}{Should a spatial effect be shared across datasets. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{spdemodel}{inla.spde model used in the model. May be a named list where the name of the spde object is the name of the associated dataset. Default \code{NULL} uses \code{inla.spde2.matern}.}

\item{pointsspatial}{Should spatial effects be used for the points in the model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{marksspatial}{Should spatial effects be used for the marks in the model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{spatialdatasets}{A vector of which datasets have spatial effects. Defaults to \code{NULL} which implies all datasets have spatial effects.}

\item{speciesmodel}{INLA \code{control.group} model to use. Defaults to \code{list(model = "exchangeable")}.}

\item{options}{INLA or inlabru options to be used in the model.}
