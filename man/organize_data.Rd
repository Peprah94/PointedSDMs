\arguments{
\item{...}{Point process datasets with coordinates of species, and optionally marks and covariates explaining the coordinates.}

\item{poresp}{Name for the response variable for the presence only datasets. Defaults to \code{NULL}. If no presence only response is found in dataset, a vector of 1's will be used.}

\item{paresp}{Name for the response variable for the presence absence datasets. Defaults to \code{NULL}. Note that this column may also be logical.}

\item{trialname}{Name of column in data denoting the number of trials used in a binomial process for the points. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{marktrialname}{Name of column in data denoting the number of trials used in a binomial process for the points. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{coords}{Vector of the names of the coordinates used in datasets. Defaults to \code{c('X','Y')} (For now should be standardized).}

\item{proj}{Projection to use if data is not a projection. Defaults to utm (hopefully).}

\item{marks}{Should the model be a marked point process. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{markfamily}{Assumed distribution of the marks. May be either a single character string or a named list/vector of each mark's distribution in the form: <mark name> = <distribution family>. Defaults to \code{"gaussian"}.}

\item{speciesname}{Name of the species name variable used in the model. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{timevariable}{Name of the time variable used in the model. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{ips}{Integration points. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{mesh}{An inla.mesh object. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{meshpars}{List of mesh parameters. Requires the following items: "cut.off", "max.edge" and "offset". Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{boundary}{Polygon of boundary for region, of class Polygon. If \code{NULL}, draws a boundary around the points.}

\item{inclmarks.}{A vector of which marks should be included in the model. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
